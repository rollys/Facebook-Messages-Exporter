# Facebook-Messages-Exporter
exports messages from .html files to .csv from your data downloaded from facebook

just select "messages" directory in your data downloaded from facebook and wait a second.

I created my own simple html parser specially for this task, 
thanks to which the program is much faster than using htmlagillitypack and uses les RAM memory
